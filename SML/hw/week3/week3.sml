1b. get_substitutions1
Write a function get_substitutions1, which takes a string list list (a list of list of strings, the
substitutions) and a string s and returns a string list. The result has all the strings that are in
some list in substitutions that also has s, but s itself should not be in the result. Example:
get_substitutions1([["Fred","Fredrick"],["Elizabeth","Betty"],["Freddie","Fred","F"]],
"Fred")
(* answer: ["Fredrick","Freddie","F"] *)
Assume each list in substitutions has no repeats. The result will have repeats if s and another string are
both in more than one list in substitutions. Example:
get_substitutions1([["Fred","Fredrick"],["Jeff","Jeffrey"],["Geoff","Jeff","Jeffrey"]],
"Jeff")
(* answer: ["Jeffrey","Geoff","Jeffrey"] *)
Use part (a) and MLâ€™s list-append (@) but no other helper functions. Sample solution is around 6 lines.

Write a function similar_names, which takes a string list list of substitutions (as in parts (b) and

names (type {first:string,middle:string,last:string} list). The result is all the full names you
can produce by substituting for the first name (and only the first name) using substitutions and parts (b)
or (c). The answer should begin with the original name (then have 0 or more other names). Example:

given:
similar_names(
  [
    ["Fred","Fredrick"],
    ["Elizabeth","Betty"],

around 10 lines.
